# simulation  Kardar Parisi Zhang equation in 1+1 dimension using the moving-mesh method
More details
------------
In this project we work on simulating the KPZ 1+1D equation using the moving-mesh method.
The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a surface. Dynamics of the interface or surface, called Surface Growth. Discrete models and continuous mathematical models are usually used to study Surface growth. Continuous mathematical models mean a stochastic differential equation. The KPZ equation is a stochastic differential equation and is a twin of the Burgers equation commonly used in fluid dynamics. The KPZ model is used to study the growth of layers of copper atoms and similar elements, which have strong interatomic aggregation properties. We try to investigate the effect of the geometric shape of the substrate on the growth process of the KPZ model in 1+1 dimension by numerical simulation.
